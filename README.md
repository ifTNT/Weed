An assignment of linear algebra at the beginning.  
But it grows out of control :D  

### Technology

* Linear algebra : )

### Dependence
* jquery if you disconnected with the internet.

### Installation
* Start a http server.
* Done.

### Usage
* Scroll the wheel: Zoom in/out
* Drag: Panning

### TODO
* Maybe evolve to a 3D version ?
* The origin of zooming should be the position of cursor.
* Faster rendering.
